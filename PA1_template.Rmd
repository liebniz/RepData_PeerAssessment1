## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
print ("hello")
unzip(zipfile = "activity.zip",overwrite = TRUE)
csv <- read.csv("activity.csv")

str(csv)
summary(csv)


library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE)

byDate <- group_by(csv, date)

sum <- summarise_each(byDate, funs(mean(., na.rm=TRUE)), -interval)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values
